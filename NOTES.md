Notes to self around going through this course.

## Self Help on Learning

Use AI prompting to get help along the way:

- ChatGPT - <https://chat.openai.com/> - may not be up to date and not trained on latest tools (ie Foundry)
- Phind - <https://www.phind.com/> - combines crawling multiple web results and formatting a response
- Peeranha - <https://peeranha.io/> - like a stack overflow for web3

1. Limit self-triage for issues to 15/20 minutes
2. Don't be afraid to ask AI, but don't skip learning
   1. Use ChatGPT and Phind
   2. Monitor for hallucinations (aka giving wrong answers)
3. Use the forums for this course
   1. <https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23/discussions>
   2. <https://web3education.dev>
4. Google the exact error
5. Post in StackExchange or Peeranha
6. Post an issue on Github/git
